        <h1>Learn TypeScript with me!</h1>
        <section>
        <p>JavaScript is a flexible language, but its lack of strict rules can lead to unexpected errors that only appear when your code runs. TypeScript fixes this problem by adding static type checking, helping you catch mistakes before your code even runs.</p>
</section>
<section><h2>What is TypeScript?</h2>
<p>Javascript is loosely typed: Which means it does not strictly enforce data types.
Typescript is strongly typed: Whereas typescript enforces strict rules about types.</p>
<h3>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. A superset of JavaScript means a language that extends JavaScript by adding extra features while still being compatible with regular JavaScript code.</h3>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What are Typescripts main features?</h2>
<ul>
<li>‚úÖ Catch Errors Early: TypeScript checks your code before it runs, preventing common mistakes.</li>
<li>‚úÖ Better Autocompletion & Hints: Your editor can suggest functions, properties, and expected values.</li>
<li>‚úÖ Custom Types: Define your own types to make your code clearer and more maintainable.</li>
</ul></section>

<h2>Learning TypeScript doesn‚Äôt have to be boring!</h2><p>First, we‚Äôll break down the basics with short, simple explanations. Then, you‚Äôll test your knowledge with an interactive matching game!</p>
<p>üß© How It Works:</p>
<ol>
<li>1Ô∏è‚É£ Read a quick explanation of a TypeScript concept.</li>
<li>2Ô∏è‚É£ Play a matching game, where you pair Vanilla JavaScript code with its TypeScript equivalent.</li>
<li>3Ô∏è‚É£ See the results! Play as many times are you would like!</li>
</ol></section>
<p>By the end, you‚Äôll have a stronger grasp of static types, error prevention, and TypeScript‚Äôs key features!</p>
